VPLS - OpenStack Service Manager
===================

This is a set of scripts and JSON files to manage starting and stopping OpenStack and supporting services and commands. I've run into a lot of problem with server shutdowns and restarts, where OpenStack services don't start up in the correct order causing a break in OpenStack functionality. Sorry, not much in the way of documentation right now.
